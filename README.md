                                                            Code Quiz 
                                                            
Technologies used:
    -JavaScript
    -CSS
    -HTML

The goal of this project is to create a code quiz that:
    1. has a time limit
    2. has a high score board that can be cleared by the user
    3. cycles through multiple screens when the answers are given
    4. subtracts 10 seconds when the wrong answer is given

Writing the code for this Quiz gave me a lot of practice and challenges with JavaScript. The really hard part for me was figuring out how to cycle through the questions on differemt screens and getting a score board to display the scores stored in localStorage.
